Transform this casual selfie into a professional studio portrait.
Enhance lighting with soft, balanced studio illumination that flatters facial features and skin tone.
Apply flawless natural makeup suitable for a high-end photo shoot — even skin tone, soft contour, natural lip tint, subtle eye definition.
Refine the hairstyle to appear well-styled and photo-ready — smooth, voluminous, and neatly arranged.
Replace casual clothing with elegant studio attire that suits the subject’s gender and age — such as a tailored blazer, silk blouse, or minimal dress/shirt.
Use a clean, softly blurred background resembling a luxury photo studio, with perfect color harmony and depth of field.
Adjust posture and composition to match a professional portrait aesthetic, maintaining realism and natural expression.
Ultra-high resolution, cinematic lighting, detailed skin texture, professional studio look.
